# About this guide {.unnumbered}

This guide is a living document documenting the protocols I use to process Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data. As such, it is somewhat biased to my use cases: processing data acquired using either the Emlid Reach RS2+ or the DJI D-RTK2 station, in the UK, USA and Brazil. 

Feel free to suggest changes or corrections, and to add base data instructions for other countries.
